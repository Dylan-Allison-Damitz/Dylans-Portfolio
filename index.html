  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Dylan Allison-Damitz, I am currently 31 years old and I live in Hillsboro, Oregon
      with my wife of 6 years, Lark, and my 13-month old daughter, Cora. We have a golden-doodle named Willow.</p>
      <br>
    <p>I graduated from Portland State Univiersity with a bachelor's degree in English, with additional studies focused
       heavily on philosophy. After graduating from Portland State I went through the application process to become
       a police officer at Portland Police Bureau. I was hired and sworn in with Portland Police Bureau (PPB) on August
       23rd, 2017. After 3 years spent on patrol I decided that police work was not for me, and shifted my focus on a career
       field that had always had ahold of my heart: technology. I've always had an affinity for technology, science, and progress,
       in general. I'd always had coding stored away in the back of my mind as I took some coding classes in high school and greatly
       enjoyed building tangible and useful things through the medium of letters and numbers. My work and life experience, as well
       as my passion for words, syntax, and creating things, should render a succesful foray into the world of computer programming.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I enjoy the outdoors, spending time with my family, playing and watching sports of any kind, listening to music, and working out.
