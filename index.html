        <p><h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>My name is <strong><em>Dylan Allison-Damitz</em></strong>, I am currently 31 years old and I live in Hillsboro, Oregon
          with my wife of 6 years, <em>Lark</em>, and my 13-month old daughter, <em>Cora</em>. We have a golden-doodle named <em>Willow</em>.</p>
          <p>I graduated from Portland State University with a bachelor's degree in English, with additional studies focused
           heavily on philosophy. After graduating from Portland State I went through the application process to become
           a police officer at Portland Police Bureau. I was hired and sworn in with Portland Police Bureau (PPB) on August
           23rd, 2017. After 3 years spent on patrol I made the decision to shift away from police work and focus on a career
           field that had long captured both my heart and imagination: technology. I've always had an affinity for technology, science, and progress,
           in general. Learning how to code for the purpose of creating websites and software was a skill I'd longed for after taking some coding classes in high school.
           After reading about Epicodus during some late-night Googling, I felt compelled to try my hand at becoming a programmer.
           As I move forward into this field, I'm confident that my work and life experience, as well as my passion for words, syntax, and creating things,
           should catalyze a rewarding journey into this</p>
        <p>I enjoy the outdoors, spending time with my family, playing and watching sports of any kind, listening to music, and working out.</p>
